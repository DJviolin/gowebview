# mobilehtml5app
Framework for building Go language (golang) mobile apps using an HTML5 supporting
WebView as the frontend and Go language HTTP servers as the backend. This gives

technologies to construct the user interfaces for our gomobile apps

More documentation to come here. For now, refer to the godoc for the
